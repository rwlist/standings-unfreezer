# standings-unfreezer

This project allows everyone to unfreeze Yandex.Contest standings in just three clicks.
I wrote this in one night and spend some more time on bugfixes.
Actually, I did this already long ago and I don't remember even how I did it. And I also think the code is not so well-written, but it works.

I just leave it here and I hope someone will find this useful. This repo is open for contributions and I invite everyone to make it better - and then use it while holding competitons.
